5. [A renju program follow AlphaZero. ](https://github.com/junxiaosong/AlphaZero_Gomoku) [Here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/32089487) is a chinese doc about it. I think this implemention has some bugs. For example the author compute final z by mistake, but when do backup he adds a negative sign, so maybe the result is ok.

### Requirements
1. This project build with bazel==2.0.0
2. [python requirements](https://github.com/kongjiellx/AlphaZero-Renju/blob/master/requirements.txt)

### Results
- Training about 24 hours, each move with 100 mcts simulations:
